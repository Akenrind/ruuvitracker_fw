This directory contains differences to sources from MicroPython.org 
https://github.com/micropython/micropython

*** Firmware upload ***
0) Alternatively compilation can be skipped if you want to use
   already compiled firmware. In that case skip to dfu-util command
   and adjust firmware.dfu path to compiled-firmware/firmware.dfu
1) Copy/merge this directory on top of micropython directory
2) Prepare RuuviTracker to firmware upload by removing battery 
   and usb and pressing second button from battery connector while
   connecting battery again and then connecting usb
3) Use shell

$ cd micropython
$ cd stmhal
$ export BOARD=RUUVITRACKER_C3
$ make
# DOES NOT WORK: make deploy
# INSTEAD USE:
$ sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 -D build-RUUVITRACKER_C3/firmware.dfu 

4) Disconnect battery and usb to reboot

*** Console connection ***
1) Connect battery and usb
2) Use shell

# For Mac
$ screen /dev/tty.usbmodem*
# For Linux
$ screen /dev/ttyACM0

3) Press extra enter if blank page
4) Type python commands like 1+2

*** Running MicroPython scripts ***
1) Connect battery and usb
2) RuuviTracker appears as USB drive in Linux and Mac
3) Copy script files from scripts directory to that drive
4) Test scripts by following help in them
